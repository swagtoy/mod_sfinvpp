# sfinv++

Slight tweaks to sfinv and some surrounding elements. Think of this as a watered down i3.

- Changes inventory size to 10x6 (This will soon be modifiable)
- Adds big chests
- Adjusts chest and furnace formspec to match inventory size (Will add support for Techage forms later)
- Adds trash button to crafting formspec
- Tweaks some other formspecs from other mods

Dependencies: `default`

Optional dependencies: `3d_armor, 3d_armor_sfinv`
